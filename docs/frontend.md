# The `/frontend` directory

In here you can put all your html, css, and javascript in the respective directories. To start, let's keep these directories flat and not creating sub directories inside `/html`, `/css`, or `/js`. This will affect the references in your backend code and we want to worry about that when we need it ([#YAGNI]('/programming_concepts.md')).


## Why is everything named the same thing?

This might look strange but I promise there for a reason for it. To start working with these different files we want to visually cue people to connect them. By this I mean all the html/css/js that is associated with the `/helloworld` page is easily found! When you are working on your projects the amount of files will get larger and you always want to reduce confusion.
